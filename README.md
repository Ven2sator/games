The user uses pygame to develop a complex 2D game with the following mechanics:
- Movable red square (player)
- Max. 5 yellow squares appear per click
- Blue dots follow the player
- On contact with player: green triangle appears randomly
- Green triangle replaces the target of the blue dots
- On reaching the triangle: both disappear, a blue square appears, chases the player, slows him down on contact
- 4 blue squares → Player turns blue himself, movement blocked → Game over
- Timer: Game over if no yellow square is collected for 30s
- Green triangle can be 'fed' with yellow square → turns into a second red square
- Second red square chases green triangles, slower than player
- If player or 2nd red square touches the green triangle: +60s and protective shield for 2nd red square
- Aim of the game: create a green triangle and become a blue square yourself
- Map has alpha wall (soft boundary)
- Score display counts collected yellow squares.
